# Language-models-experiment

In this project, I'll be experimenting with tools to create language models using Python, following the guide linked (here, will update when applicable), making use of the following corpora:
1. (Modern Standard Arabic)
2. (Mexican Spanish)

This readme will be updated with clearer structure of what the project entails within the next few days
